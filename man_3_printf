.SH DESCRIPTION
    printf ARGUMENT(s) according to FORMAT.
.LP
The functions in our _printf() family produce output according to a format as described below. the functions _withformat(), _withformat2(), _withformat3() and _withformat4() works to search the different cases of format and find the correct function, they only work together with _printf.
.br
Also functions like print_number(), printf_octa(), print_unsig(), print_hexaup(), print_hexalow(), print_hl() and print_bi() works to convert and print numbers.
.br
and the functions _putchar(), _printstring(), rot13() and print_rev() works with characters.
.LP
.B Return value
.br
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (Excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.LP
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.LP
.B The conversion specifier
.LP
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
.br
the conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.LP
 d, i   The  int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.  The preci‐
               sion, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;  if
              the  converted  value  requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left
              with zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0 is  printed  with  an
              explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.LP
   s      If  The const char * argument is expected  to be  a  pointer  to  an array
   	      of character type (pointer to a string).
              Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a ter‐
              minating  null  byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than
              the number specified are written.  If a precision is  given,  no  null
              byte need be present; if the precision is not specified, or is greater
              than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating  null
              byte.
.LP
 c      The  int  argument  is converted  to an char, and the resulting character is
 	written.
.LP
 o, u, x, X
              The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned
              decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.  The  letters
              abcdef  are  used for x conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X
              conversions.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of  dig‐
              its that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it
              is padded on the left with zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0
              is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.
.LP
b		The unsigned int argument is converted to a binary, and return the leng of number.
.LP
R	If the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an  array    of
	   character type (pointer to a string).
	   Characters from the array will be convert to rot13 notation.
.LP
r	 If  The const char * argument is expected  to be  a  pointer  to  an array
              of character type (pointer to a string).
	      The string will be printed in reverse.
.LP
p	The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.
.LP
%	A '%' is written. no argument is converted.
.LP
.B FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.
.LP
\\n new line
.LP
%% a sigle %
.LP
.B NOTE: Shell may have its own version of printf, which would be most extensive and amazing that this version.
.SH EXAMPLE
To print a integer number:
#include "main.h"
.LP
_printf("%d", integer);
.LP
integer must be have an integer value.
.SH SEE ALSO
printf(1), printf(3)
.SH BUGS
No known bugs, but this function maybe have bugs using the conversion specifiers o, u, x, X, if you find some bug
let us know :).
